# Calories Burnt Prediction 🏃‍♂️🔥

## 📝 Description 
This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burnt during exercise based on various factors such as age, gender, height, and weight. The prediction model utilizes the powerful XGBoost regression algorithm for accurate calorie estimates.

## ⌛ Dataset 
The project uses two main datasets: 'calories.csv' and 'exercise.csv'. These datasets contain valuable information about exercise routines and the corresponding calories burnt by different users.

## 🎯 Approach 
The project follows these key steps:
1. Data Collection & Processing: Data is loaded from the CSV files into Pandas DataFrames. Both datasets are then merged into a unified dataset for analysis.
2. Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the statistical properties of the data. Additionally, any missing values in the dataset are identified and handled.
3. Data Visualization: Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of age, height, weight, and gender within the dataset.
4. Data Pre-Processing: Textual data, such as gender, is converted into numerical values to prepare the data for model training.
5. Model Training: The XGBoost Regressor is employed to train the prediction model using the pre-processed data.
6. Evaluation: The model's performance is measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test data.
